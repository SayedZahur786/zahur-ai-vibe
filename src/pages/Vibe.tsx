            A glimpse into my personal aesthetic and interests outside of work

            <p>
              My approach to both work and life is minimalist and edgy with a touch of class.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I believe in removing the unnecessary to focus on what truly matters. This philosophy extends to my code (clean, efficient, well-documented) as well as my personal style (simple, modern, functional).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              There's a quiet sincerity in the way I approach things‚ÄîI like giving my full energy to whatever I commit to, whether it's writing code, cooking a good meal, or setting up a well-run event. I'm driven by momentum, not milestones. It's the act of building, improving, and staying in motion that fuels me more than the outcome itself.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Outside of tech, I find joy in the little rituals‚Äîtrying out new recipes, playing cricket under open skies, or orchestrating events where people come together effortlessly. I love creating experiences, whether through AI or atmosphere, and I believe organization is an underrated form of art.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              If you ask my close friends, they'll say I'm the person who makes space for people to just be. No social filters, no fear of judgment‚Äîjust real connection. That same mindset guides how I work: honest effort, genuine curiosity, and an energy that doesn't try to rush the process but enjoys it fully.
